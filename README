Currently, as we work on phase 1, all of our code is in the `provided`
package. The professor said that code he created must remain there in
order to work with the test cases. For future phases he said we can
organize our code however we want.

From the professor:

This file contains provided code, testers, and test cases.

provided shouls be a top level package in your src directory
JottParserTester and JottTokenizerTester classes should be in a package call testers.

the testCases directories should be in the working directory of your project.
