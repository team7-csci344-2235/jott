This is the code for Team 7's Jott implementation (CSCI-344-03).

Code that we have written -- including code copied from the `provided`
package -- has been copied into a new `team7jott` package. Source files
and the test files have been modified to pull from this package instead
of provided.

To run the tokenizer (phase 1) tests:

- Be in the root directory of the repository.
- Compile the tokenizer with `javac JottTokenizerTester.java`. This
  should also compile the code that file depends on in `team7jott`.
- Run the tests with `java testers.JottTokenizerTester`

Below the original content of the README.
